# Windra â€” The Coin That Cleans the World

Live demo: https://windra-coin.netlify.app/

A small static marketing/demo site for Windra (WND) with interactive UI elements: tabbed operations, testimonials slider, reveal-on-scroll sections, modal signup, and lazy-loaded images. Built with plain HTML/CSS and modern JavaScript and bundled with Parcel.

## Features

- Responsive, dark-themed UI
- Modal signup flow
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Tabbed operations component
- Testimonials slider with dots and keyboard nav
- Reveal-on-scroll animations
- Lazy-loading images (Parcel-friendly)

## Architecture

This repository uses a single ES module entrypoint at `src/app.js` which handles all UI behavior (modal, navigation, tabs, sticky nav, reveal-on-scroll, lazy-loading, slider). The code is written as an ES module so bundlers like Parcel can resolve asset URLs (via `import.meta.url`) to produce correct hashed asset filenames in production builds.
